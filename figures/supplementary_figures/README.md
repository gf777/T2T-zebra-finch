# Scripts for supplementary figures
To generate supplementary figures, the following scripts were used:
- [plot_chr_lengths_split_hap.py](plot_chr_lengths_split_hap.py) to generate sorted chromosome size
- [rdeval_plots.R](rdeval_plots.R) to generate read evaluation plots for HiFi and ONT data (.rd files generated using [rdeval](https://github.com/vgl-hub/rdeval)).
